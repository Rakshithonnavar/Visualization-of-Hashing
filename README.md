<h1 align="center" id="title">Visualization of Closed Hashing</h1>

<p id="description">The aim of this project is to give the visual representation of hashing. The graphical visualization of hashing gives a clear picture of how the collision is resolved using some of the collision resolution techniques.The techniques used here are linear probing quadratic probing and double hashing.</p>

<h2>üßê Features</h2>

Here're some of the project's best features:

*   Visualizing the solutions graphically will make the concept easier to understand.
*   Quadratic probing operates by taking the original hash index and adding successive values of an arbitrary quadratic polynomial until an open slot is found.
*   Double hashing is a computer programming technique used in hash tables to resolve hash collisions in cases when two different values to be searched for produce the same hash key.
*   It is a popular collision resolution technique in open-addressed hash tables.
