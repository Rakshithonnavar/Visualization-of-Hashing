# Visualization-of-Hashing
Closed Hashing Visualization
->The aim of this project is to give the visual representation of hashing. 
->The graphical visualization of hashing gives a clear picture of how the collision is resolved using 
some of the collision resolution techniques. 
->The techniques used here are linear probing, quadratic probing and double hashing.
