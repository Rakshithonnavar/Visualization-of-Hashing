Closed Hashing Visualization

The aim of this project is to give the visual representation of hashing. The graphical 
visualization of hashing gives a clear picture of how the collision is resolved using 
some of the collision resolution techniques.The techniques used here are linear 
probing, quadratic probing and double hashing.


Visualizing the solutions graphically will make the concept easier to understand. Such 
representation creates clear and complete idea in the mind of audience. Quadratic probing 
operates by taking the original hash index and adding successive values of an arbitrary 
quadratic polynomial until an open slot is found. Double hashing is a computer 
programming technique used in hash tables to resolve hash collisions, in cases when two 
different values to be searched for produce the same hash key. It is a popular collision resolution technique in open-addressed hash tables.
